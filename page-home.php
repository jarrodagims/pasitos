                            a child is embraced by a reputable, multidisciplinary healthcare team—which includes
                            doctors, therapists, psychologists, social workers, and teachers who understand and have the
                            experience necessary to respond to the child’s special needs—the child and the child’s

                        <p class="blurb">Pediatric therapy involves the child’s family almost as much as the child
                            herself. At Pasitos Clinic, we understand how difficult it is for families to deal with the
                            shock after learning their child has a developmental condition.</p>

                        <p>For this reason, we offer emotional support to families in order to help them accept and deal
                            with the many feelings that arise due to their child’s condition. We also offer information
                            in order to educate parents and families with all the facts relating to their child’s
                            condition. Knowledge is power and it’s intrinsically important for parents to know as much
                            as possible about their child’s condition. This way, the parents will be capable and adept
                            at navigating their child through habilitation and rehabilitation. </p></div>

                            Disorders (NIDCD), “nearly 1 in 12 U.S. children ages 3-17 has had a disorder relating to
                            voice, speech, language, or swallowing in the past 12 months.”</p>

                        <p>Among these children, 34 percent of those who are 3-10 years old have multiple communication
                            or swallowing disorders. Children with disabilities or developmental issues require
                            pediatric therapy services from a reputable clinic in order to live their lives to the
                            fullest.</p>

                        <p>At Pasitos Clinic, we understand the many hurdles and issues parents, family members, and
                            children face when it comes to treating disabilities and other issues. We also understand
                            the many benefits that come from successful pediatric therapy services. Through proper
                            rehabilitation services, the child will be able to surpass these hurdles on the path towards
                            living a successful, healthy life.</p></div>
